# 🧠 Retinal Image Enhancement Using GAN

A deep learning-based project that enhances the quality of retinal fundus images using a CycleGAN model. The enhanced images improve diagnostic accuracy for retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma by denoising, sharpening, and preserving fine vessel structures.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to enhance low-quality retinal images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), particularly CycleGAN, without needing paired data. Enhanced images aid ophthalmologists in better diagnosis and analysis.
